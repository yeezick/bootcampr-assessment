# Bootcampr Engineering Assessment

## Purpose

Bootcampr was made for bootcampers by bootcampers.
Our platform will help graduates find more success during their job search by giving our users the practical experience they need to stand out.

This repository will host the code assessment for engineering candidates. It will give us a baseline of your general MERN experience, capacity to deliver within a week, and ability to implement best practice & adhere to instructions.
